# Luqstore - E-commerce Website

## Description
Luqstore is a responsive e-commerce website where users can browse products, add them to a cart, and view product details. It features a hero slider, product pages, cart functionality, contact information, and an about page. The website provides a smooth shopping experience with dynamic content fetched from DummyJson  API.

## Motivation
I created Luqstore to practice building a dynamic website with real-world functionality and to showcase products online in an interactive way.

## Features
- Home page with hero slider and featured products  
- Product page displaying all products from the API  
- Add to cart and remove from cart functionality  
- Registration and login pages  
- Contact page with map  
- About page describing the website  
- Responsive design
- Animated buttons and hero text  
- Footer with social media links  

## How It Works
1. Users land on the home page and see featured products.  
2. Clicking on “Shop Now” or products leads to the product page.  
3. Users can add products to the cart and view or remove them.    
4. The contact page provides location and contact information.

## Technologies
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript  
- Font Awesome for icons  
- Dummy JSON API for products
